# Certificates

Certbot is not declared on docker file (to-do). Instead, the docker file is configured to copy certicates from the `certs` folder from the machine which docker will run, whenever docker runs. The `certs` folder (docker machine) should be placed on the root of the project and contains of the necessary files the application need to validate a cerficate. The certification renew process should be done manually and then, re-run the docker compose file
